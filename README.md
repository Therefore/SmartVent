# SmartVent
The SmartVent replaces traditional air vents and redirects heat or air conditioning to user selected rooms. This optimizes time and energy used to reach the thermostat temperature and reduces wasted enegrgy on unoccupied rooms. This makes a central forced air system act similarl to a minisplit system which are typically installed in each room. The smartvent should be used in conjunction with the 5 Button Board that can remotely sense room temperature and control vents and climate control.
